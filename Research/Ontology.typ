== Ontology vs Semantic Layer
#ref_ontology_vs_semantic_layer is a good article. It explains what ontology and semantic
layer are; their differences; and how they work together.

https://lowhangingdata.com/ focuses on data analysis. Read its introduction and the 'about' page
for more information.

== Ontology Rules

[[def:Ontology Rules, Rules]]

Entity relations are instances of 'a class', while Rules are the 'class'. 

=== Rule-001 If ... Then ...

*Example*
```text
If A is B's wife, B is A's husband
If A is an investor of B, A works for C, C is a company, then C invests B
```

=== Rule-002 Entity Class
Entity classes define a class and entities are instances of entity classes.
Rules are often defined on entity classes in ontology instead of on individual entities.
In most graphs, the class-instance relations are expressed explicitly, such as
"Mockingbird is a Bird". In ontology, entity class is an attribute of entities.

=== Rule-003 Relation Class
Relation Class defines a category of entity relations (relations for short). Relations in knowledge graphs are
instances of Relation Class. 

=== Rule-004 Relation Hierarchy
